<p>You know the old phrase, “If you want something done right, you’ve got to do it yourself”. If you are an Epsilon manager, this kind of thinking is a great way to guarantee that you will never sleep or have a personal life again. Learning how and what to delegate is an essential skill every manager should master. </p>
<p>If you’re having trouble delegating effectively, here are five tips to learn how to let go and trust your team.</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Clearly explain the objective, constraints and boundaries.</b> Make sure your associate understands exactly what you’re looking to achieve, as well as how much authority, responsibility and accountability you are delegating.</li>
	<li><b>Focus on results.</b> Your team has talent and skill. And, they probably won’t do everything the way you would. As long as they are achieving results in a safe, ethical way, let them handle the job their way.</li>
	<li><b>Be patient.</b> There are going to be tasks that you can do more quickly yourself. But, remember it took time for you to become proficient. The time you invest now will save time tomorrow.</li>
	<li><b>Assign projects appropriately.</b> Is your associate ready to learn? Do they have sufficient skill and will to be successful? Before you delegate a task, make sure your associate has the ability, tools and resources they need to be successful.</li>
	<li><b>Provide support.</b> Make sure you’re available to answer questions, act as a sounding board and provide help as needed.</li>
