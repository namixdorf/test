<p>Having tough conversations is the most challenging part of any manager’s job. Candid, honest feedback is essential to associate growth and overall team performance. It’s never fun but, like any skill it gets easier with preparation and practice. These tips can help you prepare for your next difficult conversation:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Gather your thoughts.</b> While it's important to have tough conversations in a timely manner, it’s also important to take time to collect your thoughts. Think through the reasons and circumstances that are prompting this conversation.</li>
	<li><b>Outline specific examples.</b> Be as specific as you can about the associate’s actions (or inaction) that need to be corrected.</li>
	<li><b>Question your assumptions.</b> You’re preparing for a conversation, not a lecture. So, while you want to present your take on the situation, it’s also important to be open to hearing what your associate has to say.</li>
</ul>
