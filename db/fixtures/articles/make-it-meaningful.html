<p>Effective managers know that “meaningful recognition” is a very subjective term. In other words, associates have personal preferences about recognition. One associate may love public recognition. Another may cringe at being praised in public, but adore a handwritten note or a simple $10 gift card.</p>

Simply ask, “What can I do to make you feel recognized?” in your next one-on-one meeting. Make note of what you hear. Then, the next time a recognition opportunity comes up, you’ll know exactly what to do to make your associate feel great.</p>
