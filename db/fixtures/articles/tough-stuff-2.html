<p>When you’re having the conversation, keep these three things in mind.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Stay calm.</b> A manager’s job is to point out inappropriate behavior and seek solutions, not to place blame or vent your emotions. Keep your tone and words professional.</li>
	<li><b>Explain why you’re having the conversation.</b> Clearly outline what you observed, why it matters and the repercussions if it continues.</li>
	<li><b>Ask for the associate’s perspective.</b> What does your associate think about the situation? What ideas does she have for fixing the problem? Listening to her answers will help you know she fully understands what needs to be corrected AND puts her in the driver’s seat for correcting things.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a manager, your job is to guide, coach and hold the associate accountable. Tackling tough conversations is your most powerful tool, even if it is the most challenging. For more advice and resources about how to tackle the tough stuff, explore this section’s videos, advice and resources.</p>
