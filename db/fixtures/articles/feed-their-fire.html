<p>Great Epsilon managers know how important it is to help associates grow – both in their skills and in their careers. With so many demands on our time, growth and career development can take a backseat to delivering for clients. Career development doesn’t have to be time-consuming or separate from day-to-day work. In fact, it works best when they are fully integrated. Here are some ways you can feed your associates’ career fire.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Spend ten minutes talking with your associate about their career goals. Knowing their goals helps you feed their fire effectively.</li>
	<li>Talk with your manager peers. They may have opportunities that could help someone on your team, and vice versa.</li>
	<li>Delegate. It can take longer to train someone to do a task than it would to do it yourself. However, in the long run, that training time will pay off for you and your associate.</li>
</ul>
