<p>As a manager, Epsilon expects you to be an effective coach. There is one sure fire coaching tool that every manager should be using: a weekly one-on-one touch base meeting. You might already meet weekly with your direct reports, but are you making the most of your time? Besides the usual project status questions, here are three questions to ask in every one-on-one:</p>
<ul>
	<li>What’s been going well this week?</li>
	<li>Is there anything you’d like to talk about?</li>
	<li>What can I do to help you this week?</li>
</ul>
<p>These three questions are the cornerstone of great coaching. Learn more about coaching our teams, get advice from other Epsilon managers and more in this section of the Manager Expectations Tablet.</p>
