<p>It’s a familiar story: tight deadlines, demanding clients, few resources and unforgiving budgets. With this many challenges, it’s no wonder some managers hold on tight to great associates.</p>
<p>As comforting as it is for a manager, holding talented associates too tight or too long will backfire in the long term. Talented associates need to grow and explore. It’s better that they explore and grow at Epsilon than at another organization or, even worse, at our competition. That’s why one of the Manager Expectations is to fuel our associates’ careers. You can do your part by:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Asking associates about their career aspirations on a regular basis.</li>
	<li>Delegating tasks as a way to help an associate learn and grow.</li>
	<li>Encouraging associates to explore Epsilon job openings.</li>
	<li>Giving your associates time to shadow someone in a different job or business unit.</li>
</ul>
