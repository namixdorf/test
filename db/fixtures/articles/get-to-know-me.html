<p>Being a great manager means knowing your people. It takes time, but it’s an investment that definitely pays off. When you know your team, you'll manage more effectively. When your people see the effort you take to know them, you’ll gain more trust, respect and credibility. The final result is that you and your team become more productive.</p>
<p>So how can you get to know your team? The same way you get to know anyone. Take time, ask questions and listen.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Take time.</b> Stay connected with each person on your team through weekly one-on-one meetings, informal chats and by sharing coffee or lunch from time to time.</li>
	<li><b>Ask questions.</b> The best way to learn more about someone is by asking. The topics can be all about work, but don’t hesitate to ask about family, pets, and other interests too. Everyone likes to talk about what they love.</li>
	<li><b>Listen.</b> It’s a basic skill, but one that pays off. Listening closely can help you remember important details about your team. And, don’t be afraid to jot down a few notes along the way.</li>
